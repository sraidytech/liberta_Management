# LWS Support Request - Urgent Network Issue

## Subject: Server blocking essential CDN access for application deployment

## Issue Description
Our production server is blocking access to critical CDN domains required for our Node.js application deployment, specifically:

**Blocked Domain:** `binaries.prisma.sh`
**Error:** `403 Forbidden`
**Impact:** Cannot deploy our application - Docker builds fail

## Technical Details
- **Server:** VPS107625
- **Application:** Node.js with Prisma ORM
- **Required Access:** HTTPS access to `binaries.prisma.sh` for downloading database engine binaries
- **Current Status:** All deployment attempts fail due to CDN blocking

## What We Need
Please whitelist the following domains for outbound HTTPS traffic:
1. `binaries.prisma.sh` (Primary - CRITICAL)
2. `github.com` (Secondary - for fallback downloads)

## Business Impact
- **CRITICAL:** Cannot deploy application updates
- **CRITICAL:** Cannot deploy optimized agent assignment system
- **Production deployment completely blocked**

## Urgency Level: HIGH
This is blocking our entire production deployment pipeline. We need this resolved ASAP to deploy critical business functionality.
